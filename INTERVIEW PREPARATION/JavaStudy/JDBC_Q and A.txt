1) What is JDBC?

Definition of JDBC(Java Database Connectivity) 
JDBC is an API(Application programming interface) used in Java programming to interact with databases. The classes and interfaces of JDBC allow the application to send requests made by users to the specified database. The current version of JDBC is JDBC 4.3, released on 21st September 2017.


2) What is Latest version of JDBC available?
The latest version, JDBC 4.3, is specified by a maintenance release 3 of JSR 221 and is included in Java SE 9.

3) Explain about JDBC Architecture?

The JDBC architecture consists of two-tier and three-tier processing models to access a database.
Two-tier model: A java application communicates directly to the data source. The JDBC driver enables the communication between the application and the data source. 




4) Explain about common JDBC Components?


5) Explain about DriverManager?

JDBC Driver Manager

The JDBC DriverManager is the class in JDBC API. The objects of this class can connect Java applications to a JDBC driver. DriverManager is the very important part of the JDBC architecture.

6) What is JDBC API?
The JDBC API

The JDBC API gives access of programming data from the Java. To use this, applications can execute SQL statements and retrieve results and updation to the database. The JDBC API is part of the Java platform, it includes the Java Standard Edition.


8) Who has provided JDBC API?
The JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) API is provided by Oracle Corporation as part of the Java Platform. It is a standard Java API for database-independent connectivity between the Java programming language and a wide range of databases


9) What are the classes and interfaces available in JDBC API?
Interfaces:

Driver: This interface defines the methods for JDBC drivers to register themselves with the DriverManager class.

Connection: This interface represents a connection to a specific database. It provides methods to create statements, commit/rollback transactions, and close the connection.

Statement: This interface is used to execute SQL statements. It offers methods for executing queries, updates, and deletes.

PreparedStatement: A subclass of Statement, specifically designed for pre-compiled SQL statements with placeholders for parameters. Improves performance and security by preventing SQL injection attacks.

CallableStatement: Similar to PreparedStatement, but allows calling stored procedures in the database.

ResultSet: This interface represents the result set of a query execution. It provides methods to navigate through the results, retrieve data by column name or index, and check for the end of the results.

ResultSetMetaData: Provides information about the structure of a ResultSet, including the number of columns, their data types, and column names.

DatabaseMetaData: Offers information about the database itself, such as its product name, version, supported features, and table information.

RowSet (optional): A more advanced interface for handling database result sets. It allows disconnected access to data and manipulation capabilities beyond basic ResultSets.

Classes:

DriverManager: This class manages JDBC drivers. You use it to register drivers and obtain connections to databases.

Blob: Represents a BLOB (Binary Large Object) data type in the database. Used to store binary data like images or documents.

Clob: Represents a CLOB (Character Large Object) data type, used for storing large text data.

Types: Provides helper methods for converting between Java data types and SQL data types




10) Who has provided implementation of JDBC API?
The implementation of the JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) API is typically provided by database vendors. They offer JDBC drivers that allow Java applications to connect to and interact with their specific database systems.


11) What are the steps to write JDBC Program?

Here is the 7-step process to create a Java JDBC connection:
Import the packages: ...
Register the drivers: ...
Establish a connection: ...
Create a statement: ...
Execute the query: ...
Retrieve results: ...
Close the connections:


12) What is JDBC Driver?
A JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) driver is a software component that allows Java applications to interact with databases using the JDBC API. JDBC drivers provide an interface for Java applications to connect to different database management systems (DBMS) and execute SQL queries, statements, and transactions.


13) How many types of JDBS Drivers available?
Type 1: JDBC-ODBC Bridge Driver
Type 2: Native-API Driver
Type 3: Network Protocol Driver
Type 4: Thin Driver (Direct-to-database Pure Java Driver): 

14) Explain TYPE 1 Driver?
 This driver uses the ODBC (Open Database Connectivity) API provided by the operating system to connect to the database. It translates JDBC calls into ODBC calls. However, it's not commonly used due to its dependence on ODBC and its limited platform independence.


15) Which version of Java has excluded TYPE 1 Driver?
DBC-ODBC Bridge Driver, which is a Type 1 JDBC driver, was deprecated in Java 8 and completely removed in Java 9. Therefore, Java versions 9 and onwards exclude the JDBC-ODBC Bridge Driver. Developers are encouraged to use other JDBC driver types that offer better performance and platform independence.



16) I have loaded both Oracle and MySQL drivers, Which database connection will be
established when we call getConnection(...)method?
Ans: Based on jdbc url the Connection object will be created to the database.

17) I have loaded Oracle driver and trying to get the connection with MySQL URL What
will happen?

Code:
Class.for Name("oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver");
con=DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/durgadb","root","root");
Ans: We will get ClassNotFoundException

18) What the DriverManager.getConnection() method doing?
In JDBC API or in java.sql package, SUN has given more interfaces like Connection,
Statement, ResultSet, Etc., How Instances will be created?

19) Can I register the Driver Explicitly?

Yes, you can register a JDBC driver explicitly in your Java application using the Class.forName() method. This method loads the JDBC driver class dynamically and registers it with the DriverManager.

20) Can I unregister the Driver?

In most cases, you cannot explicitly unregister a JDBC driver once it has been registered with the DriverManager. 


21) How can i find list of drivers registered?
 we can retrieve the list of JDBC drivers that have been registered with the DriverManager by calling the DriverManager.getDrivers() method. This method returns an Enumeration of all the currently registered JDBC drivers.



22) How many types of JDBC Drivers are available? Which is best?
There are four types of JDBC drivers available:
Type 1: JDBC-ODBC Bridge Driver
Type 2: Native-API Driver
Type 3: Network Protocol Driver
Type 4: Thin Driver (Direct-to-database Pure Java Driver): 
Type for driver is the best Driver..


23) Explain the cases when each driver should be used?


24) Which Type of JDBC Driver is the Fastest One?
Among the types of JDBC drivers, Type 4 drivers, also known as Thin Drivers or Direct-to-database Pure Java Drivers, are typically considered the fastest option.


25) Explain two important approaches to Register a Driver?
Using Class.forName() method − The forName() method of the class named Class accepts a class name as a String parameter and loads it into the memory, Soon the is loaded into the memory it gets registered automatically.


26) Whenever we are using Class.forName() method to load Driver class automatically
Driver will be Registered with DriverManager. Then what is the need of DriverManager
class registerDriver() method.
Ans: This method is useful whenever we are using Non-JDK Complaint Driver.
